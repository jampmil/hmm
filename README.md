# Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a Python-Based Solution

Hidden Markov Models (HMM), are a statistical Markov model, commonly defined as stochastic finite state machines, in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved or hidden states. Nowadays HMMs are commonly used in pattern recognition (speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score, etc) and fields like computational biology.
    
The present work implements a python-based solution which aims to provide the same functionality as the C++ Implementation of Hidden Markov Model, by Dekang Lin, which offers a solution for the most common challenges of the Hidden Markov models: given a model getting a sequence of observations from it; finding the most probable sequence of states of a model given a sequence of observations; and estimating the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model given a set of observed feature vectors.
